# Bachelor Thesis: Exploring the Synergy Between Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my bachelor thesis, "Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs: Opportunities and Challenges." This research, conducted as part of my studies in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Bergen (UiB), delves into the intersection of two groundbreaking technologies: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Knowledge Graphs (KGs).

## Overview

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved, with LLMs and KGs at the forefront. LLMs like GPT and BERT showcase advanced linguistic capabilities, understanding and generating human-like text. KGs, on the other hand, organize data in a structured manner, aligning with human cognition to enable logical reasoning and inference. Combining these technologies offers the potential to revolutionize AI, creating systems that are both intelligent and intuitive.

## Key Points

1. Explicit vs. Parametric Knowledge: The thesis differentiates between explicit knowledge in KGs, which is structured and easily accessible, and parametric knowledge in LLMs, which is embedded within model parameters and inferred from training data.

2. Knowledge Representation and Reasoning: KGs provide high-precision, structured knowledge, facilitating logical reasoning. LLMs excel in language understanding and generalization but face challenges with logical reasoning and numerical accuracy.

3. Integration Challenges and Opportunities: The thesis discusses the difficulties in merging these technologies, such as maintaining factual accuracy and addressing biases, while also highlighting the potential for enhanced knowledge extraction, link prediction, and rule generation.

4. Applications: Practical applications of this integration include improved healthcare systems, enhanced natural language queries, and better support for knowledge-intensive tasks.

## About This Thesis

This research is inspired and built upon seminal works, including "Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs: Opportunities and Challenges" by Pan et al. (2023) and "Unifying Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs: A Roadmap" by Pan et al. (2023). These studies provide a foundational understanding and roadmap for integrating LLMs with KGs, which my thesis further explores and expands upon.
